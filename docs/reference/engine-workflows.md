# Reference: engine workflows

`.claude/workflows/` holds the harness's Workflow-runtime modules — the
engine-path counterparts to the interactive slash commands in
[commands](commands.md). A workflow module is composed programmatically (by a
research pipeline or an orchestrating session) and returns a typed result; it
never converses with the user. One module ships today: `research-goal`
(atomic step 1 of the research pipeline, vendored under Epic #539).

## Module shape and parse-check

The Workflow runtime strips a module's `export` statement and evaluates the
remaining source as the **body of an async function**, so top-level `await`
and `return` are legal in the file — and a bare `node --check` rejects a
valid module by design. `scripts/check-workflow-syntax.sh` compile-checks
each module through the same async-body wrap (nothing executes);
`verify.sh`'s `gate_workflows` runs it on the required `verify` CI surface,
and `evals/workflow-parse-check.sh` proves the wrap is load-bearing (#552).

## Governing architecture

These modules are vendored from the research-pipeline architecture document
that governs the workspace engine (see its "Atomic action 1 — goal-writing"
section for the container catalog, flowcharts, and design-pattern rationale
— this page documents only the in-repo surface). Two of that document's
shared architectural rules are load-bearing here and inherited unchanged:

- **Typed hand-offs only.** Every `agent()` call carries a JSON Schema the
  runtime enforces; no downstream stage parses prose.
- **Write-validate atomicity.** Any agent writing corpus JSON composes it
  with `jq` and validates it with `ajv` in the same turn — a write is not
  done until it validates. This is the same contract the harness already
  imposes on findings (ADR-0002); the workflow inherits it rather than
  restating it.

## research-goal

Atomic step 1 (goal-writing): turn a raw research ask into a schema-valid,
transcript-verifiable session goal — `reports/<topic>/goal.json`, valid
against `schemas/goal.schema.json` — via prompt chaining with a validation
gate after every link. Source: `.claude/workflows/research-goal.js`.

### Args

| Arg | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `topic` | yes | — | A topic id registered in `harness.config.json` `topics[]`. An unregistered topic short-circuits the run (`ok: false`, `reason: topic-not-registered`) before anything is drafted. |
| `ask` | no | `''` | The raw research ask. When empty, the Draft phase derives the sharpest decision-enabling goal from the topic and any existing goal context. |
| `harnessDir` | no | `.` | Path to the harness instance the goal is written into. The in-repo default is the instance root, so a pipeline running inside a clone passes nothing. |

### Phases

| Phase | Model | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Context | haiku (low effort) | Reads `harness.config.json` (is the topic registered? which `dimensions[]` are config-declared?) and summarizes any existing `reports/<topic>/goal.json`, including its `gv-*` version. |
| Draft | sonnet | Follows `.claude/commands/goal-writer.md` as its operating manual. Composes `goal.json` with `jq`, validates it with `ajv` (draft2020 + ajv-formats) against `schemas/goal.schema.json`, and emits the companion `/goal` prose. Re-authoring an existing goal routes through ADR-0006's content-hashed append-only lineage — snapshot the live version to `goals/goal-<gv>.json` via `scripts/goal-version.sh`, then stamp `.version`/`.supersedes`/`.revision` — never an ad hoc snapshot. |
| Gate | haiku (low effort) | Re-runs `ajv`, then a verifiability lint: every `completion_condition.check` must be an end-state fact (not a step) that is transcript-verifiable, and every `dimensions[]` entry must be config-declared. |

### Bounded repair loop

A failing Gate triggers at most **two** repair rounds. Each round is a
sonnet repair (fix only the flagged issues, editing with `jq` and
re-validating with `ajv`; ADR-0006 lineage fields are preserved) followed by
a haiku re-lint. If issues remain after round two, the module returns
`ok: false` with the outstanding issues and the caller decides — the loop
never runs unbounded.

### Returns

A typed result: `{ ok, goalFile, goalProse, dimensions, checks, lintIssues }`
— or `{ ok: false, reason: 'topic-not-registered', context }` from the
Context short-circuit.

### Positioning: /goal-writer stays the interactive path

[`/goal-writer`](commands.md#goal-writer) remains the interactive,
user-facing path for authoring and reshaping goals — it elicits, converses,
and handles `--reshape` in dialogue. `research-goal` is the **engine path**
a pipeline composes: the same contract (the command's manual is the Draft
phase's operating manual; same schema; same ADR-0006 lineage) delivered as
a typed, non-interactive result.

For engine-composed goal authoring, this deterministic prompt chaining —
an `ajv` machine gate plus a verifiability lint after every link, with a
bounded repair loop — **supersedes prompt-discipline gating**, where a
single prompt was trusted to validate its own output. What is superseded is
prompt discipline as the gate, not the command: the interactive
`/goal-writer` path stays.
